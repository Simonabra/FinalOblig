    <h1>Rapport</h1>
    <p1>We had accessibility in mind from the start, and considered this when choosing the layout and color-scheme of
        our website. We initially wanted to go with a design that implemented the colors of the Italian flag, but
        quickly realized this would be hard to make accessible, especially for individuals who are color-blind. We
        instead went with an elegant beige and black color-scheme with high contrasts. We kept the layout clear, with
        easy navigation of the website. You can also easily navigate the website by using only the Tab and Enter keys,
        which is a very important aspect of web accessibility. The navigation bar is fixed and visible all the time.
    </p1>
    <p2>To make sure that our website was compatible for people with dyslexia, we used sans serif font, which is plain
        and evenly spaced. Sans serif font makes text more readable for individuals with visual impairments. For the
        same reason, we used dark colored text on a light background. An “antique” white background was used instead of
        plain white, because white might be too dazzling. We avoided green, red and pink colors throughout the website,
        as these colors could cause issues for people with colorblindness and dyslexia. Color contrast accessibility
        validator showed no color contrast issues.
    </p2>
    <p3>We included the main page regions to our website, such as header, navigation, main content and footer, so that
        it would be easier for web browsers to identify them.
    </p3>
    <p4>After uploading the first version of our website to AcChecker, the results were no known problems and no likely
        problems. However, we did get 27 potential problems. The majority of them were related to the image: image text,
        Alt text, etc. We fixed the problem by renaming the image and adding a brief description using the alt
        attribute. We changed the description from “pizza” to “photo of mozzarella pizza” because we realized the first
        description might be confusing to someone using a screen-reader.
    </p4>
    <p5>Have checked all the headers to make sure that they were used as section headers and not to format text.
        In terms of SEO, we used keywords such as restaurant, Italian, Oslo and pizza throughout the website. We placed
        relevant information in the correct hierarchy, for instance information regarding the dishes.
